    "## Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "Despite the title, studying and testing *Naive Bayes* is only a secondary objective of this first labwork as this method is often too elementary and can be advantageously replaced by more sophisticated methods.\n",
    "This labwork has actually two more important objectives:  \n",
    "The first goal is to ensure, before going further, that you all have a basic knowledge and practice of the standard Python libraries & tools that are the most widely used in Data Science. They are:\n",
    "  - [numpy](https://numpy.org/) for numerical computation on multidimensional arrays (similar to Matlab).\n",
    "  - [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org) for plotting various graphs.\n",
    "  - [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org) as the standard machine learning Python library, that not only provides off-the-shelf ML methods but also standard generic tools & methods like cross validation, etc.\n",
    "  - [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org) for manipulating tabular datasets similarly to a database (operations like indexing, filtering, sorting, join, etc), but in memory (so it does not suit processing of really big datasets).\n",
    "  - [seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/), maybe less importantly than the others, is a statistical data visualization library extending ``matplotlib`` to easily provide various statistical views of your dataset (descriptive statistics).\n",
    "  - [jupyter](https://jupyter.org) is a service to write interactive notebooks in different languages (including Python). This is presently what are your are using. Jupyter is largely used by data scientists to prototype some code, iteratively explore data or build tutorials. Once your code works, you better make a real module from your notebooks.\n",
    "\n",
    "While all these libraries put all together are still not as rich as **R** (the preferred language of statisticians) for analyzing data, the Python ecosystem has the advantage to have many other libraries in all fields of application of computer science. For this reason, Python is more versatile than **R** and is the preferred choice in data science.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The second goal is to illustrate some basic aspects of data analysis, including:\n",
    "  - Illustrating how a typical scenario handling data looks like (data cleansing, preprocessing & data analysis, model estimation, model evaluation then looping back to preprocessing again) based on scikit-learn, pandas & seaborn.\n",
    "  - Mentionning some beginner's traps.\n",
    "  - Presenting some practical aspects of classification: imbalanced classes and ROC AUC, cost sentitive classification, uncalibrated probabilities, etc\n",
    "  - How sometimes one must write some code to overcome the limitations of out-of-the-box algorithms.\n",

    "## Subject\n",
    "\n",
    "The labwork is a very classical application of Naive Bayes to address the problem of *spam detection*.\n",
    "*Spam messages* are massively sent and unwanted messages that one wishes to discard whereas *ham messages* are the remaining messages that should be kept.\n",
    "The term *Spam* and its relation with pork meat *ham* comes from a brand of canned cooked pork that is reused in a Monty Python sketch where all the meals in a restaurant tirelessly contain Spam.\n",
    "\n",
    "We consider here spam detection in textos (SMS) which are different from emails, as these text messages are much shorter, written in informal and sometimes slang or cryptic language with many abbreviations.\n",
    "Because this classification problem is relatively simple, Naive Bayes is a good choice as it is robust (no risk of overfitting even in small N large M problems like here), fast and simple to implement. See lectures to see how Naive Bayes works.\n",
    "\n",
    "Naive Bayes takes as input a set of monovalued features modelled by some univariate categorical or continuous distributions. \n",
    "Therefore to apply Naive Bayes to textual data, these texts have to be modelled as *bags of word*, i.e. as a large vector where each of its components represents a given word.\n",
    "We therefore work with a very high dimensional space whose size is the number of words in our vocabulary.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Recommendations\n",
    "\n",
    "Of course for the labwork to be useful you must try to answer the questions by yourself.\n",
    "However if you are stuck or some question looks unclear, you might have a look at the provided solution that is\n",

    "- If you want to edit the content of code or text cell, just double click on it.\n",
    "- To validate and run a code or Markdown cell, you must first select it and then press **CTRL + ENTER** to run it. The results (prints, etc) should appear below the cell. Pressing **SHIFT + ENTER** is almost the same but in addition, it jumps to the next cell.\n",
    "- Use the **Cell menu** to run all cells above or below.\n",

    "For our application, dataframes are also very convenient here compared to numpy arrays as every column (and these are many here) can be mapped to a header or \"title name\" (in fact, the index entry), that is the word of the vocabulary mapped to the column.\n",

    "The [Zipf's law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zipf%27s_law) is a *heavy-tailed distribution* that models particularly well the distribution of the frequency of words in many natural languages, since in most languages, very few words have a high frequency and many words have a very low frequency.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Zipf's law considers the relative frequencies $f(w)$ of every word $w$ observed in a large text corpus. Assuming words $(w_i)_{1\\leq i \\leq N}$ are sorted in decreasing order of their frequency, the Zipf's law states that \n",
    "$$f(w_i) \\approx \\frac{1}{K\\,i^s}$$\n",

    "**Question:**  \n",
    "Compare the distribution of words in textos with Zipf's law. To this end, find the optimal values for $K$ and $s$ such that the corresponding Zipf's law best matches $i \\mapsto f(w_i)$. \n",

    "On this aspect, ``scikit-learn`` appears not to be very flexible.\n",
    "In particular many methods cannot directly process categorical variables. \n",

    "  * Separate the categorical and numerical features,\n",
    "  * One-hot encode categorical features  \n",

    "Hopefully here classes and features can be processed as binary variables: \n",
    "While the value of an input feature is the number of occurrences of the word it represents in a document, the implementation of Bernoulli Naive Bayes in scikit-learn interprets such features as binary: 1 if the count is non null, 0 otherwise. As a consequence, steps 1 and 2 are useless ; you just need to do step 3 as following:"

    "## Calibration of output distributions\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine a binary classifier that is evaluated on a test dataset of $n$ samples. For every sample $i \\in \\{1 \\dots n\\}$, it outputs a probability $p_i$ that this sample is a member of class 1.\n",
    "Let us consider some interval of probability, like for instance interval $I = [0.5, 0.7]$.\n",
    "Let us define the number $n_I$ of samples whose probability $p_i$ is within interval $I$. Among these $n_I$ samples, let denote $n_I^1 \\leq n_I$ the number of positive examples. We then expect that fraction $\\frac{n_I^1}{n_I}$ will be roughly equal to $0.6$ and clearly between 0.5 and 0.7. Same for any other interval containing sufficiently many samples to make a reliable estimation. If this is true, we say that the classifier is *well calibrated*.\n",
    "\n",
    "However this is rarely the case. For instance, we just saw that Naive Bayes outputs extreme probabilities close to 0 or 1. If such a classifier was well calibrated, this would imply an accuracy of 1 but this is obviously wrong.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Calibration plot\n",
    "\n",
    "One way to check whether a classifier is well calibrated, is to plot a *calibration plot*: it consists in partitioning regularly interval $[0,1]$ into $k$ subintervals $I_i = [(i-1)/k, i/k]$ and then plotting for each subinterval $I_i$ the ratio $n_{I_i} / n$. We except the plot to be close to the main diagonal.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Question:**  \n",
    "Use the scikit-learn function ``sklearn.calibration.calibration_curve`` to draw the calibration plot."

    "This way we expect an average cost between 0 and 1.\n",
    "To add this home-made scoring function, we will use functions ``make_scorer`` and ``confusion_matrix``. See documentation [make_scorer](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.metrics.make_scorer.html) to understand how to use it.\n",
