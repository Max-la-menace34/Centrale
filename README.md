# Leet code Part :

In order to get familiar with c++ language, I do [Leet code exercices](https://leetcode.com/)<br>
This is a good way to learn and improve tour skills in other language!

## In order to run the code : <br>
Go in the same directory files (cd /path/to/the/directory)<br>
Then run the command : <br>

    g++ -o test -std=c++17 num.cpp name_of_the_file.cpp
    ./test

Dependencies : if you don't have g++ , <br>

    sudo apt install g++
Then run (should return the g++ version ) : <br>

    g++ -v
